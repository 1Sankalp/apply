# üìù VoiceFlight

## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- Voice Flight - A voice-controlled flying game
- Voice Flight is a browser game where players control a flying plane using just their voice. No login, no setup, just open and play.
- Players control the plane using the loudness and duration of their voice. The louder the voice, the higher the plane flies.
- I'm trying to grow the Polkadot ecosystem by making a quick-to-play game that anyone can play on their phone or desktop, and try to score as much as they can to earn rewards if they score high.
- I believe this has a good viral potential -- looking at the current traction.
### üîç Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

- NextJS and Tailwind CSS
- I launched the game and saw exciting early traction. I launched it on April 19th, and in just 4 days, 450+ people played it, and the site got over 650+ visits -- all organically. I posted about it on Reddit and a few Discord channels - Reddit alone brought in ~1000+ views. The game reached players from 50+ countries, across both desktop and mobile.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? - in games
- Who is your target audience? - every web2 and web3
- What need(s) does your project meet? - I make it fun for people to join in and play a game and try to earn if they score high
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem? - no

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
